      <description>Greetings!
My name is Grant Esparza and I am a DevOps Engineer at Liatrio, a Enterprise Delivery Acceleration firm. I graduated from California State University, Chico with a degree in Computer Science and moved to Sacramento shortly after. I&amp;rsquo;ve always had an obsession with tinkering and love the feeling of mastering new challenges which helps makes me one of the lucky people who finds it easy to love their job.</description>
