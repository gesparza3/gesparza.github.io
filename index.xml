      <description>My name is Grant Esparza.
I have a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science with a certificate in Data Science from California State University, Chico. Beyond academia I also am a certified Kubernetes Administrator.
My passions include learning new tooling to improve software delivery, collaborating with others to develop innovative solutions, and most importantly finding time to enjoy the outdoors with my dog.
Some of the tools I work with include Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Jenkins.</description>
